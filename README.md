## Regression Analysis 

After doing regression analysis I found out that the "out-of-sample" test data performed better then the "In-Sample" training data. A lower RMSE is better than a higher one because it indicates higher accuracy.

## Time Series Analysis 

Based on your time series analysis, would you buy the yen now?

* No, I would not buy yen now because based on time series analysis short term forecast indicates that price will fall. In addition, long-term trend indicates price decrease as well.

Is the risk of the yen expected to increase or decrease?

* Risk will be higher because volatility is expected to increase.

Based on the model evaluation, would you feel confident in using these models for trading?

* No, I would not be confident trading with these models. The ARMA and ARIMA models where not a good fit for this data because p > 0.05. The GARCH model was a better fit for the data, so to a degree I would feel confident in using GARCH model for trading.
